# 4. Pushing repository to remote location
1. Now that your project is commited in your local repository, we want to save it to some remote location.
2. Create a **Github** account if you do not have one already here: [https://github.com/join](https://github.com/join)
3. After registering and loging in, create a new remote repository where you will push your local code - [https://github.com/new](https://github.com/new). Name your repository and click **Create repository** button.
4. Quick setup guide will be displayed. Follow the instructions in **"â€¦or push an existing repository from the command line"** section to push your commited code from previous exercise to github
