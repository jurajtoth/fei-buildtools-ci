# 3. Commiting your code to GIT
1. Now that we initialized our local GIT repository we can commit our code into it.
2. Navigate to your project folder using command-line and `cd` command.
3. Add untracked files (currently all files) to GIT's staging area using `git add -A` command.
4. Commit staged files from step 3 to your local repository using `git commit -m "My first commit"` command.
	- you can read more about `git add` and `git commit` here: [https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/saving-changes](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/saving-changes)
5. You can check the history of your repository using `git log` command.
